# Cookbook Importer

Provides a simple UI for entering a recipe and formatting it into a format acceptable to import into [Paprika Recipe Manager](https://www.paprikaapp.com).

## Usage

### Saving a Recipe

To open the UI for entering a single recipe:

```sh
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=0
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

- this writes the recipe to a subfolder named `./cookbook`

### Combining for Import

To aggregate all recipes into a single file for importing into Paprika, run `aggregate.py`.

## Features

* Numbers the steps under directions.
* Converts fractional amounts to vulgar fractions (e.g. 1/4 -> Â¼).
* Cleans out any extraneous whitespace in all fields.

## Example Output Format

Documented here: https://www.paprikaapp.com/help/mac/#importrecipes

_Note: not all fields are actually presented in the UI but can be easily added._
